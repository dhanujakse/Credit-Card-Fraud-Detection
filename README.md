# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Fraudulent activities in financial systems cause significant monetary losses. The objective of this project is to build a robust fraud detection model capable of identifying suspicious transactions in real-time or near-real-time.

## Problem Statement
A financial institution faces challenges with increasing fraudulent credit card transactions. The objective is to implement a robust fraud detection system using machine learning to identify and prevent fraudulent activities, safeguarding financial assets.

## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for fraud detection.
- Identify features indicative of fraudulent transactions.
- Implement a real-time or near-real-time fraud detection system.

## Key Tasks
1. Analyze historical credit card transaction data.
2. Preprocess data, handle imbalanced classes, and engineer features.
3. Build and train a classification model for fraud detection.
4. Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance.
5. Implement the model into a real-time or near-real-time detection pipeline.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains anonymized credit card transactions.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling, handling missing values, and balancing classes using techniques like SMOTE.
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks were tested.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Real-Time Implementation:** A pipeline was designed to simulate real-time streaming of transactions.

## Results
- Achieved precision and recall scores above 90% with ensemble models.
- Random Forest and XGBoost provided the best balance of performance and interpretability.

## Goals Achieved
- Built and tested a fraud detection ML model.
- Achieved high precision and recall scores.
- Developed a simulation for real-time fraud detection.

## Scope
- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- Model development and evaluation.
- Implementation of the fraud detection system.
- Continuous monitoring and improvement.

## Future Work
- Integration with financial institutionsâ€™ transaction systems.
- Deployment of a full real-time fraud detection API.
- Continuous retraining with new data.
